ISP directs our request to a dns server which matched what we typed to a corresponding ip address.

ipv4 vs ipv6 : 
ipv4 allows only for 4 bil unique addresses.ipv6 replaces ipv4's 32 bit address with 128 bit address. Allowing for trillions of addresses
(340 TRILLION TRILLION TRILLION ADDRESSES)

We have alleviated the need for more ip addresses with NETWORK ADDRESS TRANSLATION.
Same as 2 apartments with same house number 804.
Data never gets interchanged in the same way that the apts have diff public street addresses. All overlapping private ip's have unique public
ip's.
NAT adds performance overhead and complexity.
IPV4 holds a lot of extra data in its header. This has been cut out in ipv6 to reduce overhead.
